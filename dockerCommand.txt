# Containerization and Orchestration  


## DOCKER BUILD  +  RUN   


### RUN AND TAKE IT LOCALLY - RECOMMENDED FOR DEVELOPMENT (ORCHESTRATION)  
- do it after replacement of related applications and viewing generated diagrams (volumes are attached to container but not shared from local drive)    
  ```docker compose up```  


### RUN AND TAKE IT FROM CONTAINER:  
build:  
 ```docker build -t codetoactivity:latest .```  

run (volumes are attached to container but not shared from local drive):  
 ```docker run -it --entrypoint "/bin/bash" -v ./application:/app/application -v ./img:/app/img codetoactivity:latest```  

build + run (volumes are attached to container but not shared from local drive):  
```docker build -t codetoactivity:latest . & docker run -it --entrypoint "/bin/bash" -v ./application:/app/application -v ./img:/app/img codetoactivity:latest```   




## RECREATION OF ACTIVITY DIAGRAM (bash inside container)    
FOR RECREATION OF ACTIVITY DIAGRAM IS NECESSARY TO CALL  
```mvn clean && mvn install```
